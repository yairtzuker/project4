This is my 4th project - an online E-commerce Shop.
** this app is a JWT authentication build **

On the first page a user can login or register, see how many products and orders there are in the store,
     then he will able to enter the shooping page.
When a user logs in, the last open cart is available or a new cart opens. 
In the shopping page user can add product from 4 catagories, enter quantity or delete one or all products, search for a certain product
     and order his cart of products.
On the order page, a user enters the shipping details and the order will be excecuted and the cart will be deleted.
If an admin logs in, he can edit or add products.
